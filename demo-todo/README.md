# Vue + Vuex + REST application

## Script commands

- `npm install` to install dependencies (or `npm ci` for modern installs)
- `npm run reset:db` resets [data.json](data.json) to have empty list of todos
- `npm start` to start server (http://localhost:3000)

## Delay

You can delay the initial loading by adding to the URL `/?delay=<ms>`. This is useful to simulate application bootstrapping.
